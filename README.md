IOS Dev Camp Connected Library Project
====================

 Repository for our IOT Connected Library Project.
 
Abstract:
The Little Free Library (LFL) movement enriches peoples lives through the sharing of book via publically accessable "LFL" dropbox locations.  A drop location might be a stack of books in a box or an elobrate mailbox. 

Our project's goals are to enhance the sharing and social aspects of this new movement.
We've created an open source IOT Connected LFL.  The LFL is solar powered, wifi and Bluetooth LE enabled.
The LFL can be opened and closed by our app and sofware stack.  Users will be able to use an iPhone camera to scan ISB barcodes to check in and out books.  This feature then allows anyone with the URL to see what books are avaiable.   

This project will include all the design files, schematics, and software source code  that will enable you to build your own a LFL and join an ever growing community of connected Libraries.
